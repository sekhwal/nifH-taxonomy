READ file to make taxonomy file to analysis nifH with Mothur.

#######Download and pre-analysis process########
1. Download nifH database in fasta format.
2. Grep GenBank ID using following command
	grep "^>" nifH-database.fasta >file1.txt
3. Open file (file1.txt) in Excel and prepare as only ID
	##Split (file1.txt) following command
	split -b 50k file1.txt file2.txt
4. Download all nucleotide in GenBank format of all IDs in splited files. 
5. Marge all GenBank format files using cat command.
6. Follow next process-

a.)##remove newline after specific character (;) at end of line using following command########
	awk '/;$/ { printf("%s\t", $0); next } 1' sequence.gb >file3.txt

b.)########grep lines ########
	grep -A 1 'LOCUS\|ORGANISM' file3.txt >file4.txt

c.)####remove specific extra lines such as DEFINATION, ORGANISM, -- etc.########
	grep -v '^  ORGANISM' file4.txt >file5.txt(two space before ORGANISM)

d.)##remove newline after specific character (LOCUS) at end of line using following command########
	awk '$1 == "LOCUS" {printf "%s", $0; next} 1' file5.txt >file6.txt

e.)########grep ORGANISM names########
	grep -e 'ORGANISM' sequence.gb >file7.txt

6. Open files6.txt and file7.txt in Excel and marge both as same rows as their ORGANISMS and Classification information.  
7. To convert tab to semicolon.
	First cut IDs column in another excel file and run following command
	sed 's/[[:space:]]\{1,\}/;/g' file7.txt >file8.txt
	Than insert IDs column into new semicolumn added file
8. Here, file8.txt can use as taxonomy file to analysis nifH sequencing data using Mothur. 
9. It is good file should have not more than 9 cloumn.
10. Make confirm there are not any white space end of each line inthe file.
	To remove whitespace from end of each line use following command

 		sed 's/[ \t]\+$//' space.txt >out.txt
